To add:

- Because this is a 1 off analysis the file structure is satisfactory. 
Data science best practices would calls for a wrapper around the project, like
Docker or PackRat.
- Because I'm building a random forest model I don't need to one-hot encode the
dataset. This helps explain the poor preformance of the linear regression model,
as the dataset is not built for this type of model. Additionally, R's
randomForest library does automatically converts categorical variables to dummy
variables.
