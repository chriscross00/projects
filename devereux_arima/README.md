This project uses a ARIMA time series model to forecast water level for a 
estuary, Deveruex Slough. For more than a year I collected data from loggers 
that I installed around the estuary. Two notebooks are located in the directory
reports. One contains scripts that automate the aggregation and cleaning of datasets
from the loggers. The other notebook explores the time series and creates ARIMA model.
