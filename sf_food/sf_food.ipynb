    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feeding a City\n",
    "From timeless classics like the House of Prime Rib to bizarre fusions like Sushirrito, San Francisco (SF) is know for its diverse food scene. But roaming up and down the crowded streets of SF are hundreds of mobile food facilities. These fast, casual faux resturants can be found on street corners selling mysterious meat wrapped in bacon or sprawled as far as the eye can see at their own festival. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general there are two types of mobile food facilities that can are frequently seen around any city: push carts and food trucks. The history of each is rather fascinating. In 1691 New Amsterdam, now known as New York City, began to regulate push carts selling food (2). The tradition of push carts serving lunches to city workers continues to this day.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images\\push.jpg\" width=\"30%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "*A typical push cart selling a variety of hot foods and cold beverages.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually the push cart gave way to food trucks in the 1960s, the ice cream trucks were the first to appear in the 1950s (1). These early adopters were given the derogatory name of \"roach coaches\" due to the often sub-standard health conditions and the less than ideal areas they set up shop (1). But, by the late 1990s and early 2000s attitudes towards food trucks had shifted and customers, and the food service industry as a whole, had wholeheartedly embraced these food serving trucks. Indeed, it's not uncommon to find whole areas of citys allotted to food trucks or find blogs devoted solely to finding the next hit truck.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images\\truck.jpg\" width=\"80%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "*A line of food trucks selling a variety of quick, hot items.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Data\n",
    "A mobile food facility must be permitted by the the City of San Francisco to legally sell food. The city of San Francisco publishes partial information of permit applications on their website. This dataset is taken from the San Francisco Department of Public Works. It documents the applicant, expected location, type of facility, food type, history of permits, along with other administrative facts. The complete dataset along with a full explanation of each column can be found [here](https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Mobile-Food-Facility-Permit/rqzj-sfat).\n",
    "\n",
    "From this data we will create a interactive map of the location all the permitted food facilites in SF. The SF government website does allow users to create Plotly graphs and maps, however many people simply won't use it and the visuals lack the details and clarity present in this report. While there are websites that allow food trucks to update their location, many food push carts do not utilize this tool. Instead, people go to whichever push cart is the closest. By creating this map we can expose people to more push carts in their vicinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "In order to get a complete understanding of the dataset we'll go through a number of steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Importing data\n",
    "2. Cleaning data\n",
    "3. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)\n",
    "4. Map building\n",
    "5. Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use data visualization libraries to preform EDA, as well as scipy to perform some statistical test. We'll build our interactive map with Plotly.\n",
    "Throughout this analysis we'll try to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What does the distribution of food carts and trucks look like around San Francisco? Or put simply, where are all the food carts and trucks located?\n",
    "* Are there discernible patterns in the distribution? Are they clustered togther or evenly spread out along the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interactive map of the dataset will answer the first two questions, about the distribution of food carts and trucks. EDA will explain the last question."

    "# Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the Plotly map we can see that both push carts and food trucks are clustered around areas, particularly in the Financial District, South of Market (SoMa), Bayview District and off of Bayshore Blvd. Most of SF do not have mobile food facilities. Even more than this, mobile food facility seem to be clustered around each other, meaning often times customers have choices. It's rare to find a single mobile food facility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the push carts are clustered around Union Square and off of Market Street, particularly closer to the Financial District. Both Union Square and Market Street have large amounts of people passing through on a daily basis. Union Square is argubly a tourist area which means lots of potential customers. Market Street is one of the busiest streets in SF, with many people using it to get to work. In addition to cluster together, most areas with push carts lack food trucks. This makes sense given the size of each food facility. Food trucks are significantly bigger than push carts and require a area to park and an additional area for customers to queue. On the otherhand, push carts require far less space and therefore can operate in spaces with a higher density of people, like Union Square.\n",
    "\n",
    "Food trucks dominate the mobile food scene in SF. They are more expansive than push carts and there are simply more food trucks. The large amounts of food trucks in the Financial District caters to the massive number of people who work in that area. It is not unfair to say that when combined the Financial District and SoMa is the SF skyline, due to the sheer number of skyscrapers. This high density of office workers present a large customer pool for mobile food facilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Definitive explanations for the concentrations of food trucks in Bayview District and off of Bayshore Blvd are unknown at this point, but we can speculate. Due to the relatively large amounts of industrial businesses in the Bayview District food trucks may be present there to cater to workers. Bayshore Blvd has a suprising amount of food trucks near it. Like Market Street, we can speculate that it is because it is a very active street with a large amount of pedestrians.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the map there is a obvious lack of mobile food facilities in large areas. In general, mobile food facilities are clustered around workplaces and are almost non-existent in residential areas. There is a abundance of mobile food facilities in Financial District, SoMa, the Mission District and the BayView District, the places we explored as places of work. In residential neighborhoods like the Richmond District, Sunset District and Daly City there are very few if not not no mobile food facilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall the clear trend is that density of people seems to be the biggest determinant of location for mobile food facilities."
